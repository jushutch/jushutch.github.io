## Flag #2
Difficulty: Easy  
Flag: MHCTF{hell0_w0rld_with_styl3}

This flag was hidden as a comment in the styling code for the page, styles.css. The trick here is to inspect the page
and use the sources tab to view the files that are included on the page. Searching these files for the "MHCTF" prefix is
relatively quick and straightforward.
